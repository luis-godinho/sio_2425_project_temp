## Features Implemented

### 1.Security

#### Session

- When creating a session it is sent a password that is encrypted and stored in the database
- When there is the need for a session, it is sent the session id and the password, then the repository validates the password and the session itself

#### Messages

- When the client sends a request, the request is encrypted using the repository's public key, when receiving the request decrypts the message with its private key, which is loaded as soon as the repository is started.
- When the repository sends a response, if the session is valid, uses the current session's user public key to encrypt the data and when receiving that data, the client is prompted to provide a password so its private key can be loaded to decrypt the response.

#### Protection

- When sending a message from either the client or the repository, if the message is encrypted, a timestamp is added to the message, which is going to be checked when decrypting, if the diference in time is higher than the defined time threshold, the message is going to be invalidated, in order to protect against Replay attacks.
- A checksum is calculated and added to the message before encryption, upon receiving and decrypting a checksum of the message is calculated and compared to the already calculated one, when the values don't match, the message is invalidated, in order to protect against manipulation attacks.
